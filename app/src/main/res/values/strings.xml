    <string name="lakeTahoe_information">Blue as a topaz and encircled by majestic
        peaks,
        the massive Lake Tahoe straddles the California-Nevada border and is a bucket-list essential.
        The 22-mile-long lake can fill a record book with its statistics: It’s the 10th deepest lake
        in the world, the second-deepest in the U.S. after Crater Lake, and boasts 72 miles of shoreline.
        It’s also one of the purest lakes in the world, with 99.99 percent purity, roughly the same
        as distilled water.But of course, it’s not Tahoe’s numbers that one remembers after a visit.
        It’s the sights. An osprey diving into a ripple-less cove, a black bear drinking water at
        the lake’s edge.</string>
